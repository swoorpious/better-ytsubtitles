### Usage
Can be used with any extension which lets you add custom css.

These edits were made with [Stylus](https://add0n.com/stylus.html) for custom css. 

### Pros & Cons
- Makes YouTube subtitles look prettier, use less space, and less obtrusive.
- Subtitles don't move with progress bar hiding.
- Takes away the ability to reposition subtitles; can be changed otherwise (not included).
- Pleasing to read on unbusy backgrounds; may be difficult to read in extreme cases.
